# Online Dentist Appointment System

A modern web application for managing dental appointments, built with React. This system allows patients to schedule appointments, dentists to manage their schedules, and dentist as the administrator for adding services and other dentist

## What it does

### For Patients
- Book appointments with your favorite dentist
- See your upcoming appointments
- View your appointment history

### For Dentists
- Manage your daily schedule
- Add/update/delete dental services
- Add/update/delete dentist users
- See who's coming in

## Tech stuff I used

- React for the frontend
- Bootstrap for styling
- React Router for navigation
- React Big Calendar for the scheduling
- Axios to talk to the backend
